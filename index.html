                I am currently working at the XRT Laboratory under guidance of Ryan McMahan currently working with
                providing a streamlined technique for rendering and presenting data from a point cloud. In relation with this
                project I have authored RecolorCloud as a side tool to labelCloud for

<!--               <br style="margin-bottom: 5px">-->
                While my background largely is composed of HCI topics such as Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality, and Augmented
                Reality, I have a diversified set of skills in tackling multiple problems such as complex systems in
                robotics, computer vision, and machine learning integration.

            <h4 class="centering_property"> Hobbies and Other Misc.</h4>

            <p class="centering_text" >
                Aside from general work involving my research and studies I also do side hobbies such as gaming, 3D modeling,
                AI art, and other art forms. Generally I tend to keep my art separate from my work, however there are multiple
                times where my work crosses over to the other from time to time. I also attempt whenever there are spare resources
                and time to try to learn new concepts in application of software and hardware.
